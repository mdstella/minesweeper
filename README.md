## Changelog/decisions
1. Breakdown and task creation for the complete project
    - Created githb issues from T1 to T12 based on the priority (this might change during the development process, but at least will provide some guide)
    - Also as a branching strategy will create, if possible, 1 branch from master for each issue under the name T{X}. In a regular process should go under code reviwe before merging it into master, here I will merge it as soon as I have some working code to show progress
